# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment - Issue Fixed!

## ðŸ”§ Problem Solved

The Railway deployment was failing due to package-lock.json sync issues. This has been **fixed** with:

1. âœ… **Updated package-lock.json** - Synced with new dependencies
2. âœ… **Improved Dockerfile** - Fallback to `npm install` if `npm ci` fails
3. âœ… **Updated nixpacks.toml** - More robust dependency installation
4. âœ… **Removed Railway CLI dependency** - Use global installation instead

## ðŸš€ Deploy Now - Updated Instructions

### Option 1: Direct Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"** (or connect your Git provider)
4. **Select this repository**
5. **Set environment variables** from `.env.railway.example`
6. **Deploy!**

### Option 2: Railway CLI (Alternative)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI globally (not as project dependency)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### Option 3: Automated Script

```bash
# Run the complete deployment script
./scripts/railway-deploy-complete.sh
```

## ðŸ”‘ Critical Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard **before deploying**:

### Master Dashboard Database
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MASTER_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-master.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_MASTER_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbG...
MASTER_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbG...
```

### Shared CMS Database  
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://shared-cms.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbG...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbG...
```

### API Integrations
```
VERCEL_TOKEN=vercel_xxx
BITBUCKET_USERNAME=your-username
BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN=your-token
BITBUCKET_WORKSPACE=trukraft
BITBUCKET_MASTER_REPO=cms-master
```

## âœ… Verification

After deployment, check:

1. **Health endpoint**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
2. **Dashboard**: `https://your-app.railway.app`
3. **Create test CMS instance** to verify full functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result

Your Master Dashboard will be live on Railway and able to:
- âœ… Create new CMS instances
- âœ… Deploy them automatically to Vercel
- âœ… Manage multiple sites from one dashboard
- âœ… Handle AI theme generation
- âœ… Scale with Railway's infrastructure

The dependency sync issue is now resolved - you're ready to deploy! ðŸš€
