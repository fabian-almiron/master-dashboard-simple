4. Get your deployment URL

### 2. Database Setup (5 minutes)
1. Create Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run `database-schema.sql` in SQL Editor
3. Copy your credentials from Supabase dashboard

### 3. Configure Environment Variables (2 minutes)
1. In Vercel: **Project Settings → Environment Variables**
2. Add the three required variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
