# 🔧 Railway Environment Variable Fix Applied

## ✅ **Issue Identified & Fixed**

The problem was that **environment variables were being read at build time** instead of **runtime**. This is why your Railway deployment showed the setup screen even though the environment variables were correctly set.

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

Updated `lib/master-supabase.ts` to:
- ✅ **Read environment variables at runtime** instead of build time
- ✅ **Lazy-load Supabase clients** to ensure proper initialization
- ✅ **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing code

## 🚀 **Automatic Redeployment**

Railway will **automatically redeploy** your application from the git push. This typically takes 2-3 minutes.

## 🔍 **How to Verify the Fix**

### 1. **Wait for Redeployment**
- Check Railway dashboard for new deployment
- Wait for "Ready" status

### 2. **Test Health Endpoint**
```bash
curl https://v0-cms-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### 3. **Check Dashboard**
Visit: `https://v0-cms-production.up.railway.app/master`

You should now see:
- ✅ **Dashboard loads properly** (no setup screen)
- ✅ **Statistics display** (even if 0 instances)
- ✅ **"Create New Website" button** works
- ✅ **All navigation** functional

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After the redeployment, your Master Dashboard will:
- ✅ **Connect to your existing master database**
- ✅ **Show any existing CMS instances**
- ✅ **Allow creating new CMS instances**
- ✅ **Work exactly like your local development**

## 📊 **Next Steps**

Once the fix is deployed:
1. **Test creating a CMS instance** to verify full functionality
2. **Set up custom domain** (optional)
3. **Configure monitoring alerts**

The environment variable runtime fix should resolve the setup screen issue! 🎉
