# 🎯 Starter Content Guide

Your CMS now automatically creates professional placeholder content when deployed! This guide explains what gets created and how to customize it.

## 🚀 What Gets Created Automatically

When you deploy a new CMS instance, the system automatically creates:

### 📄 **Pages**
- **Home Page**: Hero section, features, and call-to-action
- **About Page**: Company story, mission, vision, and values
- **Services Page**: Service offerings with pricing table
- **Contact Page**: Contact information and contact form

### 🎨 **Templates**
- **Default Header**: Professional header with logo and navigation
- **Default Footer**: Complete footer with links and contact info
- **Page Templates**: Blank page and pre-designed layouts
- **Business Templates**: Professional business page layouts

### 🧭 **Navigation**
- Fully linked navigation menu
- All pages automatically connected
- Mobile-responsive navigation

### 📝 **Content Features**
- Professional placeholder text
- Call-to-action buttons with proper links
- Contact information placeholders
- Pricing tables with sample plans
- Testimonials with placeholder reviews
- Feature sections with icons

## 🔧 How It Works

### Automatic Setup During Deployment

1. **Site Creation**: When a new site is deployed, the system detects it's empty
2. **Template Creation**: Default header, footer, and page templates are created
3. **Page Generation**: Professional pages with rich content are built
4. **Navigation Setup**: Menu is created and linked to all pages
5. **Content Population**: Placeholder content with proper CTAs is added

### Manual Setup (If Needed)

If automatic setup doesn't work, you can run it manually:

```bash
# Run the starter content setup
npm run setup-content

# Or run the complete setup including deployment
npm run setup:complete
```
